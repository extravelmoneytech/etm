                    <p class="text-black/60 mt-4 text-sm font-normal font-['Plus Jakarta Sans'] leading-[21px]">Wire Transfers are electronic fund transfer across a network that is administered by a collaboration of hundreds of Indian and International banks across the world.

                    <p class="text-black/60 mt-4 text-sm font-normal font-['Plus Jakarta Sans'] leading-[21px]">A Foreign Currency Demand Draft is another way to send money outside India. Pay for tuition fees, medical expenses, emigration or VISA related fees etc. Demand drafts are made in 'favour' of the beneficiary. This means that for the beneficiary to receive the money the draft has to be submitted at the bank, hence they are a safe option. DDs can be made again by the issuing bank if they are lost or stolen</p>
