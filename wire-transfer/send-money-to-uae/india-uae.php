                <p class="text-black/60 mt-4 text-sm font-normal font-['Plus Jakarta Sans'] leading-[21px]">Wire Transfers are an electronic method of funds transfer across a network managed by hundreds of Indian and International banks across the world. Using this you can transfer money from your Indian Bank account to another account outside India. Wire transfers are considered to be a safe and secure way of sending money to different countries. The usual time period for the transfer to take effect lasts anywhere between 1-2 days.</p>

                <p class="text-black/60 mt-4 text-sm font-normal font-['Plus Jakarta Sans'] leading-[21px]">A Foreign Currency Demand Draft is another method alongside Wire transfers, that is employed for dealing with international money transfers, be it for tuition fees, medical expenses or VISA fees etc. Demand drafts are made 'favouring' the beneficiary. This means for the beneficiary to receive the money the draft has to be encashed in the bank. DDs can be re-issued if lost or stolen.</p>
